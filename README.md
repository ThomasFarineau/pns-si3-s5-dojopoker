Student project : Dojo Poker
=================================

Rewriting in Kotlin of my first team project at Polytech Nice

*Note that I have entirely redone the project alone*

Added
------------------
- [x] Implementation of the internationalization
- [x] Implementation of a multi-player system (>2)
- [x] Implementation of a random card selection for dojo poker
- [x] Implementation of the dual game mode (texas hold'em *without bet* and dojo poker)
  - [x] DojoPoker functional
  - [ ] TexasHoldemPoker functional

*This is my first project totally realized in Kotlin since 0, it allowed me to learn how the formatting of this language works, how much better it is than java (faster to write) but also that the compilation is slow, in spite of that, I think of not using Java any more in the future (out of course)*

Difficulty encountered
------------------
- Algorithm for determining poker hands
- Conversion of the standard input into a poker hand (syntax check, duplicates...)
